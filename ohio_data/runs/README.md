# File Contents

Each file is as part of a run performed by Alex in Ohio State with the prototype detector.

## Naming Scheme

The number corresponds to the run number. Since each run requires the detector to be rotated 90 degrees, the r is given to the files that hold the rotated part of the run. The files look the same inside, the orientation of the detector in space is what changed.
