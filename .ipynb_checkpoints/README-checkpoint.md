## General Information
A Detector was developed with scintilating plastic. A collection of 64 bars on the end of a 64 channel SiPM. Each bar is about 8mm long, 5mm wide, 2.5mm thick.


## Data Collected in Ohio
The data collected in ohio by Alex is in the directory ohio_data/runs. The detector was rotated for each run which is denoted by \_r in the filename. The data files given by the photoniq software is pretty cluttered so the extracted data is stored in ohio_data/extracted with the same naming scheme as before.


## Data Generated by Geant
All of the files created by Geant4 are saved in geant_data in a directory describing when they were generated.

## Gate Simulations
Here is where I will be creating the new geant4 simulations with the opengate collaboration wrapper. The geant runs from luke and them are all wrong. The Issue was the script we used to manipulate the simulation's start and end.

## Notebooks
### data_procesing.ipynb
The notebook used to extract the data from the original photoniq files is named data_processing.ipynb

### plotting.ipynb
The notebook that will be responsible for creating all of the plots of the energy deposition
