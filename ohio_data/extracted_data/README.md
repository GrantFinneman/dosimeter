# What is contained here
Each data file in onio_data/runs has a corresponding file here. These files are 2 columns, the first column is the channel number and column 2 is the total energy deposition of that channel by using the sum

## NOTE

R22 and R22_r are both empy and as such useless, so they are not in this directory
